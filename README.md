# License Manager Application

This Application was built for Ginesys in the Summer of 2016. 

A hybrid web app built on AngularJS using Ionic which connects with an MSSQL database using a REST API and displays client details with their licences and keys. The UI/US is minimal and fluidic with optimizations for data load, search and display.
